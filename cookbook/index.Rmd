# Preface {-}

This book is about checking data with the
[validate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=validate) package for
[R](https://www.r-project.org). 

This version of the book was rendered with `validate` version 
`r packageVersion("validate")`.  The latest release of `validate` can be installed
from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) as follows.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("validate")
```

The purposes of this book include demonstrating the main tools and workflows of
the `validate` package, giving examples of common data validation tasks, and
showing how to analyze data validation results.

The book is organized as follows. Chapter \@ref(sect:intro) discusses the bare
necessities to be able to follow the rest of the book. Chapters
\@ref(sect:varlevelchecks) to \@ref(sect:statisticalchecks) form the 'cookbook'
part of the book and discuss many different ways to check your data by example.
Chapter \@ref(sect:indicators) is devoted to deriving plausibility measures
with the `validate` package.  Chapters \@ref(sect:work) and
\@ref(sect:rulefiles) treat working with validate in-depth. Chapter
\@ref(sect:comparing) discusses how to compare two or more versions of a
dataset, possibly automated through the
[lumberjack](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lumberjack) package.  The
section with Biblographical Notes lists some references and points out some
literature for further reading.
