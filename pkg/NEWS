version 0.2.4
- New set membership operator "%vin%", behaving consistently with "=="
- Set membership operator %in% is now replaced with %vin% (#80).
- Added `[[<-` and `[<-` methods for validator objects.
- Validation rules can now be endowed with user-defined metadata, see ?meta (#59).
- fixed (harmless) compiler warning (thanks to Brian Ripley)
- bugfix: empty [] selection on expressionset crashed (thanks to Anne Petersen)
- bugfix: NA in validating expression would crash parser (thanks to Masafumi Okada)


version 0.2.0
- new object of class 'indicator'
- validation rules now support if-then-else syntax.
- validaton rules can now contain embedded if-statements, e.g. A | (if (B) C)
- expressionset objects (validator, indicator) can be combined using '+'
- results of getter functions (e.g. 'labels') are now named.
- less verbose printng of options for expressionset objects (validator, indicator)
- expressionset objects (validator, indicator) can now be coerced to as.data.frame.
- confrontation objects (validation, indication) can now be coerced to data.frame.
- safer expression manipulation under the hood.
- breaking: 'rule' column now called 'name' in summary of 'confrontation' objects.
- bugfix: character indexing with multiple elements of expressionset objects would crash.
- bugfix: proper recycling for replace methods in expressionset.

version 0.1.8
- Added loggers for the 'lumberjack' package: lbj_cells and lbj_rules
- Tolerance for checking (non-strict) linear inequalities is now controlled by voptions(lin.ineq.opts).
- Macro assignments through `:=` are no longer put in brackets.

version 0.1.7
- The missingess counters are now only internally documented and will be deprecated (the
  introduction of the '.' made them more or less obsolete).
- Package now 'depends' on methods to allow dispatch on objects inhereting from data.frame
- bugfix: The assignment created(<validator>) <- <POSIXct> was broken. #65, thanks to Andrew R Gibson.
- bugfix: Simple equallity checks on character data behaved unexpectedly. #67, thanks to Kevin Kuo.
- Native routines now registered as required by updated CRAN policy.

version 0.1.5
- The '.' is now used to reference the validated data set as whole.
- Small change in output of 'compare' to match the table in van den Broek et al. (2013)
- registered native routines as now recommended by CRAN

version 0.1.4
- 'confront' now emits a warining when variable name conflicts with name of a reference data set
- Deprecated 'validate_reset', in favour of the shorter 'reset' (use 'validate::reset' in case of ambiguity)
- Deprecated 'validate_options' in favour of the shorter 'voptions'
- New option na.value with default value NA, controlling the output when a rule evaluates to NA.
- Added rules from the ESSnet on validation (deliverable 17) to automated tests.
- added 'grepl' to allowed validation syntax (suggested by Dusan Sovic)
- exported a few functions w/ keywords internal for extensibility
- Bugfix: blocks sometimes reported wrong nr of blocks (in case of a single connected block.)
- Bugfix: macro expansion failed when macros were reused in other macros.
- Bugfix: certain nonlinear relations were recognized as linear
- Bugfix: rules that use (anonymous) function definitions raised error when printed.

version 0.1.3
- initial release
